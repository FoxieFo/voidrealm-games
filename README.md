# Voidrealm Games

Voidrealm Games is a pet project where I contributed as a frontend developer, bringing the design to life with React and SCSS. The page is fully responsive and crafted to deliver a seamless user experience across devices.

## Features
- Built with **React** for a dynamic and scalable structure.
- Styled with **SCSS** for maintainability and flexibility.
- **Fully responsive** design for a smooth experience on all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **React**
- **SCSS**
- **Vite**

## Designer
The UI/UX design was created by Ellie (tg: @alena_xarchenko). My role was to translate the vision into code, ensuring accuracy and responsiveness.

## Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voidrealm-games.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd voidrealm-games
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Future Plans
Currently, the project consists of a single page, but thereâ€™s potential for expanding it with additional features and pages.
